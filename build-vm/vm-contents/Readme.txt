1.Launch Visual Studio from the taskbar
2.Open your transformation project. (You can select a default ABB tranform srcml project if you dont have any tranformation project) 
3.Enable the "SrcMl Preview Panel" addin from the add-ins menu. The "transformation preview pane" should appear.
4.Select the first "Browse..." button to select a source folder. i.Navigate to your source code 
ii.Press "OK"
iii.The buttons will disable briefly while the source code is converted into srcML.
5.Build the project -- the add-in should update saying that transformations have been loaded.
6.You can now play with any of the provided transformations.
7.In order to preview a transform, simply press "Test". You can double click on any of the results to see the original source code. Once you're happy with the results, select an output directory (the 2nd "Browse..." button) and then press "Execute." Notepad++ compiles, runs, and operates without error.
